# SQL_DataManagement
Data Management Design Project  
In our Data Management with SQL class, my team partner and I were challenged to create a new data management design for a Children's wear database. We had to create master and child tables with their respective columns and data types designed to address some possible pain points that Children's wear would phase when trying to extract information from their databases.  
We listed the pain points and proceeded to create a new system flow with the tables we thought were going to be easier to extract information. We created an ERD diagram to show the system flow, primary keys, and data types. Lastly, we created queries, views, and procedures that showed how they would be addressed the mentioned pain points.
